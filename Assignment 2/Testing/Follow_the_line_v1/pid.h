/*PID Controller Class Header File

 * Henry Hickson
 * 
 * This controller is a velocity sensitve PID controller for the 3PI+
 * Notes:
 * - P: the Proportional part of the controller simply sends an error signal back to
 * the controller. This is multiplied by a gain value and added to the motor power
 * input to increase or decrease power as needed to meet our speed requirements.
 * - I: the Integral part of the contoller integrates the above mentioned error and 
 * adds the result. This helps to remove steady state error - the differnece betwee
 * the desired speed, and the speed set by the P controller.
 * - D: the derivative term is used to remove overshoot errors when switching from
 * one demand to another. For example, a sudden change from fwd motion to bwd motion
 * would normally result in a large error which can cause issues for the PI controller
 * which will try to instantly correct this with a large, usually excessive response.
